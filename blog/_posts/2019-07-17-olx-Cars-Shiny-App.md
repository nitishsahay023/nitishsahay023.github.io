How much should I sell my car for?
----------------------------------

I was moving to another country and had to sell a lot of things in a
limited amount of time. This included my car too which I bought exactly
a year back for 285K in INR. What should I expect from selling my car
was a question I needed an answer for. So I decided to use central limit
theorum(mean, median & mode) and bit of visualization to get the right
price.

I collected the price, manufacture year and few other features from
[olx](https://www.olx.in/) of all the Hyundai i10s in my city and
created a `shiny` app in `R`.

You can access the code along with the data
