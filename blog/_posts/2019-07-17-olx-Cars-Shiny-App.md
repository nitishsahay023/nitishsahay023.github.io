### How much are people willing to pay for my car?

This question haunted me for a couple of hours when I was about to post
an ad to sell my car.

So I decided to write a script with a bit of viz to get a price which
should have a high probabibilty of creating enough buzz.

Along with that an app which I can use for quick reference at this
[app](https://nitishsahay.shinyapps.io/olxCarsGit/)

The data in the application is scraped from olx.in for Hyundai i10 only
in Bangalore, India.

Access the code along with the data and try it yourself
