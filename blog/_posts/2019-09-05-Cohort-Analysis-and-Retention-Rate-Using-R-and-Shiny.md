Retention Rate & Cohort Analysis
--------------------------------

Within the e-commerce field, customer retention metrics can be
considered crucial for several reasons. Among these, the virtual absence
of a barrier to entry for competitors in the virtual arena makes online
sellers willing to build an enduring relationship with their customers.

From the possible methods available for finding retention rates and
understanding the customer journey, I will use one from the family of
cohort methods.

In this method, customers are divided into groups (that is, cohorts)
that share relevant segmentation attributes.

I have created simulated data for customers who joined in OCT 2018 and
how have they contributed till APR 2019 for a fictitious eCommerce
company selling fashion/lifestyle products.

Hence, customers can be divided by gender, brand, category and so on.
