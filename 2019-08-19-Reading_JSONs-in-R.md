Scrape data from eCommerce Site using R and JSON
------------------------------------------------

Scraping data from web has become very easy through libraries which read
html. The best example I found and used for a couple of months for it’s
simplicity and tidy principles is `rvest` by Hadley Wickham

However, scraping data from sites which employ Infinite Scroll becomes
tricky as loading of a category, viz. men-tshirts becomes a challenge
due to very high number of options present. There are 2 ways to handle
such situations. 1. Use RSelenium currently maintained by ROpenSci 2.
Read JSONs recieved

The code written in R scrapes JSONs from an indian ecommerce site,
jaypore.com, however, it can be extrapolated to get product level data
from most ecommerce sites across the globe
